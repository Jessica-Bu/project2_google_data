Group project from Jessica Budwilowitz, Sherin Kuruvilla, Viktoria Gluhovskaya, Julie Tring.


Task: Analyzing a dataset that contains data of 10k Play Store apps for analysing the Android market. Found on kaggle.com: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps.

Our goal is to define the characteristic of a successful app.

Our hypothesis : 
Apps in categories like Games and Social tend to have higher installs.
Higher-rated apps receive more downloads.
Paid apps have, on average, higher user ratings.
There is an optimal app size range that maximizes downloads and ratings.
Price negatively impacts the number of downloads.

The tasks were cleaning and aggregating the dataset, performing data analysis using MySQL and creating visualizations using the pandas library to support data-driven insights.
